Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.

Egg is a web application designed during a group challenge asked during the bootcamp Le Wagon. This project was realized over 5 days with the Ruby on Rails framework (languages used: Ruby, HTML, SCSS and Javascript) by three students: Charlotte Smets, Mohammad Ewaz and Cl√©ment Azalbert.

It is a clone of the Airbnb concept: instead of renting apartments, you can rent a hen.
